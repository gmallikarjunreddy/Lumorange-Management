# üîß **FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT FIXES - COMPLETE**

## ‚ùå **Problem Identified:**
```
MySQLdb.IntegrityError: (1451, 'Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (`lumorange_db`.`employees`, CONSTRAINT `employees_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`department_id`) REFERENCES `departments` (`id`))')
```

This error occurs when trying to delete a department that has employees assigned to it, violating foreign key constraints.

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented:**

### **1. Fixed Department Deletion (`/delete_department/<id>`)**
- **Added Constraint Check**: Verify if department has employees before deletion
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages explaining why deletion failed  
- **Safe Deletion**: Only delete departments with no employees
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation messages with department names

#### **Before (Problematic):**
```python
@app.route('/delete_department/<int:id>')
def delete_department(id):
    cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
    cur.execute("DELETE FROM departments WHERE id = %s", (id,))  # ‚ùå Fails with foreign key error
    mysql.connection.commit()
    cur.close()
    return redirect(url_for('departments'))
```

#### **After (Fixed):**
```python
@app.route('/delete_department/<int:id>')
def delete_department(id):
    try:
        cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
        
        # ‚úÖ Check if department has employees first
        cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department_id = %s", (id,))
        employee_count = cur.fetchone()[0]
        
        if employee_count > 0:
            # ‚úÖ Prevent deletion and show helpful message
            flash(f'Cannot delete department: {employee_count} employees are still assigned to this department. Please reassign or remove employees first.', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('departments'))
        
        # ‚úÖ Safe to delete
        cur.execute("DELETE FROM departments WHERE id = %s", (id,))
        mysql.connection.commit()
        flash(f'Department deleted successfully!', 'success')
        
    except Exception as e:
        flash(f'Error deleting department: {e}', 'danger')
        
    return redirect(url_for('departments'))
```

### **2. Enhanced UI for Department Management**
- **Smart Delete Buttons**: Show disabled button for departments with employees
- **Visual Indicators**: Different button states based on employee count
- **Helpful Tooltips**: Explain why deletion is not allowed

#### **Template Updates:**
```html
{% if dept[4] > 0 %}
<!-- ‚úÖ Disabled delete button for departments with employees -->
<button class="btn btn-outline-secondary" 
        title="Cannot delete - has {{ dept[4] }} employees"
        onclick="alert('Cannot delete this department: {{ dept[4] }} employees are assigned. Please reassign employees first.')"
        disabled>
    <i class="fas fa-ban"></i>
</button>
{% else %}
<!-- ‚úÖ Active delete button for empty departments -->
<a href="/delete_department/{{ dept[0] }}" 
   class="btn btn-outline-danger" 
   title="Delete Department"
   onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete department: {{ dept[1] }}? This action cannot be undone.')">
    <i class="fas fa-trash"></i>
</a>
{% endif %}
```

### **3. Fixed Employee Deletion with Better Business Logic**

#### **Added Employee Deactivation (Recommended Approach):**
```python
@app.route('/deactivate_employee/<int:id>')  # ‚úÖ Business-friendly approach
def deactivate_employee(id):
    # Set status to 'inactive' instead of deleting
    cur.execute("UPDATE employees SET status = 'inactive' WHERE id = %s", (id,))
    # Preserves all historical data (salaries, payroll, projects)

@app.route('/activate_employee/<int:id>')  # ‚úÖ Reactivation option
def activate_employee(id):
    cur.execute("UPDATE employees SET status = 'active' WHERE id = %s", (id,))
```

#### **Enhanced Delete Employee (For Complete Removal):**
- **Dependency Check**: Verify no salary, payroll, or project records exist
- **Clear Error Messages**: Explain which dependencies prevent deletion
- **Alternative Suggestion**: Recommend deactivation instead

### **4. Updated Employee Interface**
- **Status-Based Actions**: Different buttons for active/inactive employees
- **Activate/Deactivate**: Business-appropriate employee management
- **Warning Messages**: Clear explanation of permanent deletion risks
